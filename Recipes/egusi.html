    <h2>How to know about</h2>
    <p>
        The soup takes its name from egusi, or agushiâ€•the seeds that both thicken and flavor it. 
        Egusi soup typically features meat (such as beef, smoked poultry, goat, cow skin, and offal) and 
        seafood (smoked dried fish or stockfish), as well as awara (Nigerian tofu), mushrooms, and greens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contrary to popular opinion, Egusi is not necessarily an original Yoruba soup, 
        despite the distinctive style of cooking, since it is eaten by West Africans, 
        from the Igbo tribe in Nigeria, all the way to Ghana, where it is called 'Agushie'.
